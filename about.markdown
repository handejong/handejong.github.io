I'm a neuroscience postdoc in the [Stephan Lammel Lab](http://lammellab.org/) at UC Berkeley. I'm interested in dopamine neurons and the role they play in drug addiction and eating disorders. Previously, I did my PhD in Utrecht (The Netherlands) in the labs of Roger Adan and Louk Vanderschuren.

I design, build, and program fiber scopes for <i>in-vivo</i> calcium imaging and for recording from novel biosensors. I also record electrical signals from individual neurons using [Neuropixel probes](https://www.neuropixels.org). This allows me to perform very detailed measurements in the brain in order to study the neurobiology of self control.

In addition, I work on a variety of data science projects. I'm specifically interested in (Bayesian) statistical analysis of freely available datasets, finance data and social media analysis.

I'm originally from The Netherlands but I currently live in San Francisco. Last summer, my fianc√© and I were forced to cancel our in-person wedding because of the pandemic, and [got married on zoom instead](https://wedfuly.com/pandemic-wedding-virtual-katherine-woodward/). It was the best thing ever.

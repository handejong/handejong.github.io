My name is Han, I'm a neuroscience postdoc in the [Stephan Lammel Lab](http://lammellab.org/) at UC Berkeley. I'm interested in dopamine neurons and the role they play in drug addiction and eating disorders. Previously I did my PhD in Utrecht (The Netherlands) in the labs of Roger Adan and Louk Vanderschuren.

I design, build and program fiber scopes for <i>in-vivo</i> calcium imaging and to record from novel biosensors. I also record electrical signals from individual neurons using [Neuropixel probes](https://www.neuropixels.org). This allows me to perform very detailed measurements in the brain in order to study the neurobiology of self control.

In addition I work on a variety of data science projects. I'm specifically interested in (Bayesian) statistical analysis of freely available datasets, finance data and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I'm available for data science consultancy.

I'm originally from The Netherlands, but I currently live in San Francisco. Last summer my fianc√© and I, forced to cancel our in-person wedding because of the pandemic, [got married on zoom](https://wedfuly.com/pandemic-wedding-virtual-katherine-woodward/) and it was the best thing ever.

<i>Ex-vivo</i> [Slice Electrophysiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology) (commonly known as 'patching') is a technique where by we insert a tiny [patch pipet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology#/media/File:Patch_pipette.jpg) into a neuron in order to record from it. It's a very involved process that requires a lot of practice. Patching your first neuron is generally [cause for cellebration](http://lammellab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2015-03-07-15.56.40-e1512171993740.jpg). I've used slice electrophysiology to study the effects of cocaine administration on synaptic plasticity on projection-defined dopamine neurons. Since it was important to me to be able to identify which exact neuron I recorded from, I filled my pipets with a dye called biocytin. While recording from dopamine neurons the biocytin difuses into the cell, which allowed me to later inspect the cell underneath a microscope. The images below are all dopamine neurons obtained in this matter. They are in a brain area between the brain stem and the cerebrum called the 'Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA)'.

The cells in the background (in red) are all dopamine neurons as well.

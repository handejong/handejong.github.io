<p>Iâ€™m a neuroscience postdoc in the <a href="http://lammellab.org/">Stephan Lammel Lab</a> at UC Berkeley. Iâ€™m interested in dopamine neurons and the role they play in drug addiction and eating disorders. Previously, I did my PhD in Utrecht (The Netherlands) in the labs of Roger Adan and Louk Vanderschuren.</p>

<p>I design, build, and program fiber scopes for <i>in-vivo</i> calcium imaging and for recording from novel biosensors. I also record electrical signals from individual neurons using <a href="https://www.neuropixels.org">Neuropixel probes</a>. This allows me to perform very detailed measurements in the brain in order to study the neurobiology of self control.</p>

<p>In addition, I work on a variety of data science projects. Iâ€™m specifically interested in (Bayesian) statistical analysis of freely available datasets, finance data and social media analysis. Iâ€™m available for data science consultancy.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m originally from The Netherlands but I currently live in San Francisco. Last summer, my fiancÃ© and I were forced to cancel our in-person wedding because of the pandemic, and <a href="https://wedfuly.com/pandemic-wedding-virtual-katherine-woodward/">got married on zoom instead</a>. It was the best thing ever.</p>

I"~<p><i>Ex-vivo</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology">Slice Electrophysiology</a> (commonly known as ‘patching’) is a technique whereby we insert a tiny <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology#/media/File:Patch_pipette.jpg">patch pipet</a> into a neuron in order to record from it. It’s a very involved process that requires a lot of practice. Patching your first neuron is generally <a href="http://lammellab.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2015-03-07-15.56.40-e1512171993740.jpg">cause for cellebration</a>. I’ve used slice electrophysiology to study the effects of cocaine administration on synaptic plasticity on projection-defined dopamine neurons. Since it was important to me to be able to identify which exact neuron I recorded from, I filled my pipets with a dye called biocytin. While recording from dopamine neurons the biocytin difuses into the cell, which allowed me to later inspect the cell underneath a microscope. The images below are all dopamine neurons obtained in this matter. They are in a brain area between the brain stem and the cerebrum called the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA).</p>

I'm a neuroscientist at UC Berkeley in the lab of [Stephan Lammel](http://lammellab.org/). I'm interested in dopamine neurons and the role they play in how we perceive our environment. Previously I've published on the role of [dopamine in food and drug addiction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154616300638) as well as in the processing of [aversive events](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318309966?via%3Dihub). Currently I'm interested in the role dopamine plays in information processing and the way in which we perceive and process our environment in general. I use high-density electrode arrays ([Neuropixels](https://www.neuropixels.org/)) to record from 100s of neurons in the mouse brain. At the same time, I use a technique called ["optogenetics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics#:~:text=Optogenetics%20is%20a%20biological%20technique,specifically%20in%20the%20target%20cells.) to selectively activate dopamine neurons using laser light. 

I have extensive experience with the acquisition and analysis of high-dimensional longitudinal datasets and an intuitive understanding of both traditional statistics as well as machine learning. Apart from my academic work I've applied this skill set to social media analysis, A/B testing for mobile app development, and finance datasets.

I'm a neuroscientist at UC Berkeley in the lab of [Stephan Lammel](http://lammellab.org/). My primary research focus lies in understanding dopamine neurons and their crucial role in shaping our response to salient cues in the environment. My past contributions include research into [dopamine's influence on food and drug addiction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154616300638) as well as its impact on the processing of [aversive events](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318309966?via%3Dihub). Currently I'm interested in the role dopamine plays in information processing and the way in which we perceive and process our environment in general. I do this using a combination of <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> technologies such as [Neuropixels](https://www.neuropixels.org/), [optogenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics) and [fiber photometry]({% post_url 2023-09-27-fip_system %}). These techniques allow me to map the activity in individual neurons and brain pathways of living rodents. I then use this data to build computational models of how the brain mediates motivated behavior.

Beyond academia, I've applied my expertise in managing high-dimensional longitudinal datasets to sectors like social media analytics, user behavior analysis for mobile apps, and financial data analysis.

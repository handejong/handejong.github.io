### The role of dopamine in the processing of aversive events
Dopamine neurons are traditionally thought of as being involved in the signaling of salient pleasant experiences as well as the cues (signals) that predict them. However, in a [recent publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318309966) we showed that there exist a particular subset of dopamine neurons that are excited by aversive events and the cues that predict them. We did this by selectively recording from different dopamine projections using [fiber photometry]({% post_url 2023-09-27-fip_system %}). We then mapped the inputs onto these neurons to identify the source of the aversive information and identified the Lateral Hypothalamus (LH) as a major contributor.

To give you an idea of what this research looks like in practice I include the video below. In this video a mouse is seen freely exploring a rectangular arena. In the top-right corner of this arena is something that has an unpleasant smell to the mouse (formaldehyde). Driven by curiosity the mouse does go over to that corner several times but runs away quickly every time after smelling the formaldehyde. Watch what happens to the neural activity in LH neurons that project to the VTA (depicted in green on the right) during this behavior:

### The role of dopamine in motivation for food and drugs of abuse

"Why is it so challenging to lose weight or quit smoking? Millions grapple with these questions as they strive to regulate their eating habits or break away from addiction. I am particularly fascinated by how environmental stimuli—like the aroma or sight of appetizing food—sway our actions. Furthermore, I'm keen on understanding how we can master the cravings and impulses triggered by these cues. My prior research delved into self-control in the realm of [eating addiction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154616300638) and explored how the dopamine system's alterations can affect [motivation for and control over food and drug intake](https://www.nature.com/articles/npp201560). Presently, at UC Berkeley and backed by the [Brain & Behavior Research Foundation](https://www.bbrfoundation.org/), I combine in-vivo and ex-vivo electrophysiology with calcium imaging and optogenetics with a goal to uncover how the Nucleus Accumbens integrates dopaminergic and glutamatergic signals to drive reward-seeking based on cues.

On a related note, for those intrigued by the power of habits and their influence on our lives, I highly recommend ['The Power of Habit'](https://charlesduhigg.com/books/the-power-of-habit/) by Charles Duhigg. Duhigg not only delves into the neuroscience of habits and the role of the dopamine system, but he also highlights how marketers and civil-rights pioneers have harnessed our habits to guide our behavior."

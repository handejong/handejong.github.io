### The Neurobiology of self-control

Why is it difficult to lose weight or to quit smoking? These are questions that millions of people ask themselves when they try to control their own food intake or kick a bad habit.

My research focusses on the neurobiology of self-control. I’m interested in how stimuli in our environment (for instance the smell or appearance of tasty foods) influence our behavior and how we can exert control over the urges and cravings induced by these environmental cues.

I’ve previously studied self-control in the context of [eating addiction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154616300638) and I’ve studied how manipulations of the dopamine system influence [motivation for and control over food and drug consumption.](https://www.nature.com/articles/npp201560) Currently, as a postdoc at UC Berkeley I combine in-vivo and ex-vivo electrophysiology with calcium imaging and optogenetics to explore the interaction of dopamine and glutamate afferents to different sub-regions of the Nucleus Accumbens in reward seeking.

### Heterogeneity within the Mesolimbic Dopamine system

Dopamine neurons projecting from the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) to the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) are involved in the signaling of salient pleasant experiences as well as the cues (signals) that predict them. However, in our recent [neuron publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627318309966) we showed that a subset of dopamine neurons projecting to the ventral-medial NAc is excited by aversive events and the cues that predict them.
